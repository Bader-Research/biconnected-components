span_CRCW.c : spanning tree algorithm, SV
span_gw.c: spanning tree algorithm, Graph walk
span_gw_euler.c: new ways to construct euler tour by DFS
euler.c: old ways to construct euler tour and tree computations

bicc_tv.c: Tarjan and Vishkin's implementation. using sorting to set up the
euler tours.

bicc_cas: The same as bicc_tv.c except that the spinlocking version of spanning
tree is used.

bicc_filter: NEW. We found a spanning tree, then find a spanning forest from the
non-tree edges. Prove that using the tree edges + forest edges is enough to find
all the biconnected comps. Thus filtering out a lot of non-tree edges.
helps: labeling edge pairs that should be considered in connected comps ; and
get low-high.
