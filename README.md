# Biconnected Components

The code provides an implementation of parallel biconnected components
algorithms for SMPs, as a module for SIMPLE/SMP. Our new parallel
algorithm includes various optimization techniques that significantly
improves the performance of finding biconnected components of a graph
on symmetric multiprocessors (SMPs). Finding biconnected components
has application in fault-tolerant network design, and is also used in
graph planarity testing.
